Introduction of the Project
Project Title: Student Report Management System
Introduction:
Each student or enrollee in this project is assigned a specific instructor for each course.
The report management system module will total and compute the information provided
by the students, and the outcome will be a rating of each student's academic performance.
This will keep track of the student's conduct and performance during the course of the
lesson.
Problem Statement:
Data loss, manual performance monitoring of students are typical problems that student
management departments in educational institutions deal with. The duties that these
activities generate for teachers and school officials are numerous. Lack of security also
made their records vulnerable to theft. There are still many issues to be explored, but we
only focused on the most significant ones.
Proposed Solution:
The report management system makes it easy for the professors, students and other
student service departments of the institute to keep track of students’ performance and
development so that the optimal decisions for the student’s learning path may be made.
Scope of the Project:
This system is intended to be extremely effective and user-friendly. Its duties might
include managing  tests and exams marks and calculating grades and anything else
required to keep the administrative branch of the school operating smoothly.
